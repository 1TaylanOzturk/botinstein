# Botinstein

This project contains a Discord bot I made with Discord.js for my school's Discord channel. You can also use this for your school's Discord channel.

## How it works.

I will explain how this bot works on my school's Discord channel since I actually made this bot for my school's Discord channel.

First off, let's cover specific roles for Botinstein. We have some roles of classes like 9A, 10B, 12E representing classes in our school.
For example, if someone has the 10B class role, this means the member is, in our school, in 10B and a member of 10B class.
Similar to these classes, we have a `Misafir` role meaning `Guest` in English. We assign this role to those who are not currently in any
class from our school. Except these roles, we have a `Muted` role representing members who are unable to speak or join in any kind of
voice channels. And unsurprisingly, we have a `Bot` role to represent bots in our server. <br />
To cover specific channels for Botinstein, we have `👋-hoş-geldiniz-👋`, `📢-duyuru-📢`, `👍-öneriler-👎` channels meaning
`👋-welcome-👋`, `📢-announcement-📢`, `👍-suggestions-👎` respectively and lastly the `❗reports❗` channel.
In the welcome channel, Botinstein greets new members. In the announcement channel, Botinstein makes announcements.
In the suggestions channel, Botinstein reacts to the suggestions with thumbs-up and thumbs-down for voting the suggestion.
